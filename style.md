# Ripple UI Style Guide  
### Indie Builder Aesthetic (v1.0)

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

Ripple follows an **Indie Builder aesthetic**.

The goal is:

- Calm  
- Tasteful  
- Lightweight  
- Non-corporate  
- Builder-first  

Ripple is **not**:

- A SaaS dashboard  
- A marketing landing page  
- A startup growth product  
- A glossy AI brand  

Ripple is:

> A quiet signal surface curated by a thinking individual.

## 2. Layout Rules

### 2.1 Structure

- Single-column layout  
- Centered container  
- Max width: `680–760px`  
- Generous vertical spacing  
- No cards  
- No shadows  
- No heavy visual containers  

Structure:

Page  
├── Header  
├── Signal List  
└── Footer (minimal)  

---

### 2.2 Signal Row Structure

Each signal is a single decision unit.

Required elements:

- Index number  
- Title  
- Meta line (topic · source · time)  
- Optional lightweight activity indicator  

Do not include:

- Large badges  
- Multiple icons  
- Colored blocks  
- Status bars  
- Visual noise  

---

## 3. Typography System

Typography is the primary visual identity.

### 3.1 Font Stack

Primary recommendation:

- Inter  
- Geist  
- IBM Plex Sans  

Fallback:

- system-ui  

---

### 3.2 Hierarchy

| Element | Weight | Size | Tone |
|----------|--------|------|------|
| Title | 600 | 18–20px | Primary |
| Meta | 400 | 13–14px | Muted |
| Index | 400 | 13px | Subtle |

Rules:

- Title must visually dominate.  
- Meta must visually recede.  
- Avoid excessive font weights.  

---

### 3.3 Line Height

- Body: `1.6–1.7`  
- Title: `1.3–1.4`  
- Comfortable scanning rhythm.  

---

## 4. Color System

Color is restrained.

### 4.1 Base Palette

- Primary text: `#111`  
- Secondary text: `#666`  
- Background: `#ffffff` or `#fafafa`  

### 4.2 Accent

Only one accent color allowed.

- Muted blue or muted green  
- Used only for:
  - Hover states  
  - Links  
  - Subtle emphasis  

No gradients.  
No vibrant multi-color schemes.  
No heavy saturation.  

---

## 5. Interaction Rules

Interaction must be subtle.

### 5.1 Hover

Title hover:

- Underline  
- Or 2px bottom border  
- Transition: 100–150ms ease  

No animation bounce.  
No motion exaggeration.  

---

### 5.2 Click Feedback

- Light opacity shift  
- 100–150ms transition  
- Immediate response  

No large visual shifts.  

---

## 6. Tags and Topics

Avoid colorful tag blocks.

Preferred style:

AI · Research · Startup  

or  

Small muted dot + text  

Do not use:

- Filled colored pills  
- Heavy borders  
- High contrast badges  

---

## 7. Density Guidelines

Ripple is medium-high density.

- Compact vertical spacing  
- Minimal decorative padding  
- Every row should feel intentional  

But:

- Never cramped  
- Never aggressive  

---

## 8. Header Style

Simple.

Ripple  
Signals for AI builders  

Right side navigation:

- About  
- GitHub  

No hero section.  
No oversized brand statement.  

---

## 9. Visual Anti-Patterns

Ripple must avoid:

- Card-heavy layouts  
- Dashboard UI  
- Bright gradients  
- Corporate SaaS styling  
- Overuse of icons  
- Multi-layer shadows  
- Complex animation  

---

## 10. Emotional Tone

Ripple should feel:

- Thoughtful  
- Confident  
- Unrushed  
- Human  
- Builder-native  

It should not feel:

- Marketing-driven  
- Venture-backed  
- Growth-optimized  
- Hyper-polished  

---

## 11. Guiding Principle

When in doubt:

Remove instead of add.

Ripple’s design strength comes from:

Typography, hierarchy, restraint.

If a design choice increases noise, remove it.

If a component does not improve clarity, delete it.

---

## 12. Long-Term Consistency Rule

Do not change:

- Font system  
- Layout width  
- Color palette  

Without versioning this document.

Stability > novelty.
